# Computational Physics (Lab) - M.Sc. Physics University of Delhi

## Semester: III Course Code: PH-CL502

As per our university syllabus, "This course is intended to be an Introduction to a **Programming Language C** as well as application for Numerical Analysis. The course would impart training in the structure of the programming language as well as train the students in using programs to numerically solve problems in various areas. In addition, it will also familiarize the students to the Unix environment."

We have been given a manual to practice the problems and here I'll commit the programs as I successfully compile and get the desired output.<br>
